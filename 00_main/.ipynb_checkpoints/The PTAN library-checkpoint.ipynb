    "# The PTAN library\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, PTAN provides the following entities:\n",
    "- Agent: a class that knows how to convert a batch of observations to a batch\n",
    "of actions to be executed. It can contain an optional state, in case you need\n",
    "to track some information between consequent actions in one episode.\n",
    "(We will use this approach in Chapter 17, Continuous Action Space, in the\n",
    "deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) method, which includes the\n",
    "Ornstein–Uhlenbeck random process for exploration.) The library provides\n",
    "several agents for the most common RL cases, but you always can write your\n",
    "own subclass of BaseAgent.\n",
    "- ActionSelector: a small piece of logic that knows how to choose the action\n",
    "from some output of the network. It works in tandem with Agent.\n",
    "- ExperienceSource and variations: the Agent instance and a Gym\n",
    "environment object can provide information about the trajectory from\n",
    "episodes. In its simplest form, it is one single (a, r, s') transition at a time, but\n",
    "its functionality goes beyond this.\n",
    "- ExperienceSourceBuffer and friends: replay buffers with various\n",
    "characteristics. They include a simple replay buffer and two versions of\n",
    "prioritized replay buffers.\n",
    "- Various utility classes, like TargetNet and wrappers for time series\n",
    "preprocessing (used for tracking training progress in TensorBoard).\n",
    "- PyTorch Ignite helpers to integrate PTAN into the Ignite framework.\n",

    "## Action selectors\n",
    "In PTAN terminology, an action selector is an object that helps with going from\n",
    "network output to concrete action values. The most common cases include:\n",
    "- Argmax: commonly used by Q-value methods when the network predicts\n",
    "Q-values for a set of actions and the desired action is the action with the\n",
    "largest Q(s, a).\n",
    "- Policy-based: the network outputs the probability distribution (in the form\n",
    "of logits or normalized distribution), and an action needs to be sampled from\n",
    "this distribution. You have already seen this case in Chapter 4, The Cross-\n",
    "Entropy Method, where we discussed the cross-entropy method.\n",
    "An action selector is used by the Agent and rarely needs to be customized (but you\n",
    "have this option). The concrete classes provided by the library are:\n",
    "- ArgmaxActionSelector: applies argmax on the second axis of a passed\n",
    "tensor. (It assumes a matrix with batch dimension along the first axis.)\n",
    "- ProbabilityActionSelector: samples from the probability distribution\n",
    "of a discrete set of actions.\n",
    "- EpsilonGreedyActionSelector: has the parameter epsilon, which\n",
    "specifies the probability of a random action to be taken."

    "## The agent\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent entity provides a unified way of bridging observations from the\n",
    "environment and the actions that we want to execute. So far, you have seen only\n",
    "a simple, stateless DQN agent that uses a neural network (NN) to obtain actions'\n",
    "values from the current observation and behaves greedily on those values. We have\n",
    "used epsilon-greedy behavior to explore the environment, but this doesn't change\n",
    "the picture much.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the RL field, this could be more complicated. For example, instead of predicting\n",
    "the values of the actions, our agent could predict a probability distribution over the\n",
    "actions. Such agents are called policy agents, and we will talk about those methods\n",
    "in part three of the book.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other requirement could be the necessity for the agent to keep a state\n",
    "between observations. For example, very often one observation (or even the k last\n",
    "observation) is not enough to make a decision about the action, and we want to keep\n",
    "some memory in the agent to capture the necessary information. There is a whole\n",
    "subdomain of RL that tries to address this complication with partially observable\n",
    "Markov decision process (POMDP) formalism, which is not covered in the book.\n",
    "The third variant of the agent is very common in continuous control problems, which\n",
    "will be discussed in part four of the book. For now, it will be enough to say that in\n",
    "such cases, actions are not discrete anymore but some continuous value, and the\n",
    "agent needs to predict them from the observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To capture all those variants and make the code flexible, the agent in PTAN is\n",
    "implemented as an extensible hierarchy of classes with the ptan.agent.BaseAgent\n",
    "abstract class at the top. From a high level, the agent needs to accept the batch of\n",
    "observations (in the form of a NumPy array) and return the batch of actions that it\n",
    "wants to take. The batch is used to make the processing more efficient, as processing\n",
    "several observations in one pass in a graphics processing unit (GPU) is frequently\n",
    "much faster than processing them individually.\n",
    "The abstract base class doesn't define the types of input and output, which makes\n",
    "it very flexible and easy to extend. For example, in the continuous domain, our\n",
    "actions will no longer be indices of discrete actions, but float values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In any case, the agent can be seen as something that knows how to convert\n",
    "observations into actions, and it's up to the agent how to do this. In general,\n",
    "there are no assumptions made on observation and action types, but the concrete\n",
    "implementation of agents is more limiting. PTAN provides two of the most common\n",
    "ways to convert observations into actions: DQNAgent and PolicyAgent.\n",
    "In real problems, a custom agent is often needed. These are some of the reasons:\n",
    "- The architecture of the NN is fancy—its action space is a mixture of\n",
    "continuous and discrete, it has multimodal observations (text and pixels,\n",
    "for example), or something like that.\n",
    "- You want to use non-standard exploration strategies, for example, the\n",
    "Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process (a very popular exploration strategy in the\n",
    "continuous control domain).\n",
    "- You have a POMDP environment, and the agent's decision is not fully\n",
    "defined by observations, but by some internal agent state (which is also\n",
    "the case for Ornstein–Uhlenbeck exploration).\n",
    "All those cases are easily supported by subclassing the BaseAgent class, and in the\n",
    "rest of the book, several examples of such redefinition will be given."

    "universal, and later in the book, you will see ways of dealing with that. DQNAgent\n",
